    <h1>Compiler User Guide</h1>

    <p>
        The Cmajor project contains four compilers: <span class="bold">cmc</span>, <span class="bold">cppcmc</span>, <span class="bold">masmcmc</span> and 
        <span class="bold">cmcmc</span> all of which can be accessed from the <span class="bold">cmcode</span> IDE.
        The first three are implemented in C++ and share a common front-end. The fourth is written entirely in Cmajor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The front-end parses each Cmajor source file and generates an abstract syntax tree from it. Then it generates a bound tree representation from the syntax tree.
    </p>

    <h2>
        cmc
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">cmc</span> back-end processes the bound syntax tree produced by the front-end and generates LLVM intermediate code from it. 
        The intermediate code is compiled to object code and object code is archived to libraries by calling LLVM libraries.
        Programs are linked by calling <span class="bold">clang++</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>
        cppcmc
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">cppcmc</span> back-end processes the bound syntax tree produced by the front-end and generates very primitive C++ from it.
        The generated C++ is comparable to intermediate code more than hand-written source code. Each C++ file is then compiled to object code by calling <span class="bold">g++</span>.
        The object code files are archived to libraries by calling <span class="bold">ar</span>. Programs are linked by calling <span class="bold">g++</span>.
        This back-end has some support for source-level debugging in the <span class="bold">cmcode</span> IDE.
    </p>

    <h2>
        masmcmc
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">masmcmc</span> back-end processes the bound syntax tree produced by the front-end and generates Cmajor intermediate code from it. The intermediate files have <span class="bold">.i</span> suffix.
        The intermediate code is compiled to x64 assembly code by the back-end. The back-end generates <span class="bold">.vcxproj</span> project files that references the assembly files and
        compiles the assembly files to object code by calling <span class="bold">MSBuild</span> that calls <span class="bold">msvc</span> and MASM.
        The object code files are archived to libraries and programs are linked by calling <span class="bold">MSBuild</span> that calls <span class="bold">msvc</span> and linker.
        This back-end supports assembly-level debugging by means of opening the <span class="bold">.vcxproj</span> project files in Visual Studio.
    </p>

    <h2>
        cmcmc
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">cmcmc</span> compiler parses each Cmajor source file and generates an abstract syntax tree from it. It then generates bound tree representation from the syntax tree and
        generates Cmajor intermediate code from the bound tree.
        The intermediate code is compiled to x64 assembly code by the compiler. The compiles generates <span class="bold">.vcxproj</span> project files that references the assembly files and
        compiles the assembly files to object code by calling <span class="bold">MSBuild</span>.
        The object code files are archived to libraries and programs are linked by calling <span class="bold">MSBuild</span>.
        This compiler supports assembly-level debugging by means of opening the <span class="bold">.vcxproj</span> project files in Visual Studio.
        The source code of the compiler is included in the installation package.
